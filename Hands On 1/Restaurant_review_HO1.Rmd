## R Markdown

Introduction
The goal of this document is to show how to perform different analyses of text documents at a word level, mainly using the tm (text mining) package in R.

```{r include= FALSE}
library(tm)
library(ggplot2)
library(wordcloud)
library(RWeka)
library(reshape2)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
